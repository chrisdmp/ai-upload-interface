- **Geneva**: Cutting-edge sustainability policies, urban resilience initiatives, and architectural competitions.

## **📌 Key Objectives**
### **1️⃣ Data Collection**
- Gather **sustainability regulations, architecture competitions, and urban datasets** for Athens & Geneva.
- Store them in an AI-accessible format.

### **2️⃣ Data Processing**
- Convert PDFs and structured datasets into an **AI-readable knowledge base**.
- Use **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and **LLMs (Large Language Models)** to make this data interactive.

### **3️⃣ AI Integration**
- Develop **AI tools** that enable users to ask **complex urban and sustainability-related questions**.
- Implement a chatbot or query-based system for rapid data retrieval.

### **4️⃣ Practical Applications**
- Assist in **architecture competitions** by analyzing sustainability criteria.
- Support **urban planners & architects** with instant regulatory insights.
- Enhance **decision-making** for public & private urban projects.
